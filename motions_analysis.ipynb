Since\\nits inception in 2007, it has grown to become the largest cricket league in\\nthe world, attracting sponsorship that exceeds that of most national teams.\\n\\nTraditionally, cricket competition has been dominated by international events\\nand national teams touring other countries, and has involved games lasting\\neither five days or one day. The IPL popularized large-scale domestic cricket\\nleagues, and is played in a shorter, three-hour format of cricket called\\nTwenty20 (T20). Teams are allowed up to 4 international (non-Indian) players\\nin their teams. Additionally, the IPL usually lasts 3-4 months, taking up a\\nsignificant portion of the annual cricket calendar.</td>\n",

       "874  New psychoactive substances (NPS) are synthetic drugs designed to mimic the\\neffects of illegal substances, with altered chemical structures to evade drug\\nlaws. New versions of these drugs are continuously being produced by\\nclandestine drug laboratories and released into the public, predominantly for\\nrecreational use.  \\nThere are two approaches to prohibiting these drugs. Individual listing, which\\nis traditionally used in drug listing, only prohibits drugs explicitly named\\nby legislation. Analogue listing pre-emptively prohibits drugs that are\\nsimilar to existing illegal substances, either based on chemical composition\\nor effects of consumption.   \n",
